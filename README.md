# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes using two classification models: Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifier. It utilizes the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" dataset for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database." It contains various medical predictor variables and an outcome variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (optional)


## Usage

1. Upload the dataset "diabetes.csv" to your Google Drive (optional).
2. Open the code file in Google Colab or any Python environment.
3. Install the required libraries if necessary.
4. Run the code cells sequentially to execute the analysis and prediction.
